# Changes

In this section we document all the changes between the two different versions
of our API, in order to make it easier to upgrade your client code.

## Migration guide

The new `v7` Todoist API is still based on the original Todoist Sync API (as was
the case for the `v6` API), so the differences between the two APIs aren't as
extended as those between the `v5` and `v6`.

The main difference between the two APIs is that the `seq_no`, ie. the sequence
number which was basically an always increasing number, is not used anymore to
implement the incremental sync functionality, but instead the `sync_token` has
been introduced, a string hash value. So in order to do the initial full sync
instead of `seq_no=0`, one needs to send `sync_token=*`. Other than, the last
known value of `sync_token` should be used in order to an incremental sync,
similar to what was done before with the `seq_no`.

Here follows a list of various minor changes from the previous API version:

* The `sync_token` value is not returned by the `sync` call anymore, but the
  `sync_token` and the `full_sync` variables are returned instead.
* The `sync` call now returns all objects in underscore naming convention,
  instead of CamelCase, so the `Collaborators`, `CollaboratorStates`,
  `DayOrders`, `Filters`, `Items`, `Labels`, `LiveNotifications`,
  `LiveNotificationsLastRead`, `Notes`, `Projects`, `Reminders`,
  `SettingsNotifications`, `SyncStatus`, `TempIdMapping`, and `User` objects,
  where renamed to `collaborators`, `collaborator_states`, `day_orders`,
  `filters`, `items`, `labels`, `live_notifications`,
  `live_notifications_last_read`, `notes`, `projects`, `reminders`,
  `settings_notifications`, `sync_status`, `temp_id_mapping`, and `user`,
  respectively
* The `DayOrdersTimestamp` has been deprecated, and instead the `sync_token` is
  used to keep track of updates.
* The `UserId` variable is not returned by the `sync` call anymore.
* The `timezone` and `tz_offset` properties of the user were replaced by the
  `tz_info` object.
* The `is_dummy` and `guide_mode` properties of the user were removed.
* The `has_push_reminders`, `beta`, `restrictions`, and
  `dateist_inline_disabled` properties of the user were moved to the `features`
  object.
* The `uid` property of labels was removed.
* The `user_id` property of filters was removed.
* The `due_date` property of reminders was removed.
* The `user_id`, `archived_date`, and `archived_timestamp` properties of
  projects were removed.
* The `due_date` property of items was removed.
* Only 10 notes per item are returned with the `sync` call and thus the
  `get_item` call should be used for more.
