# Overview

This is the official documentation for Todoist Sync API. A reference to the
functionality our public API provides with detailed description of each API
endpoint, parameters, and examples.

## Summary of contents 

In the [Getting started](#getting-started) section we will try to
present to you the Todoist API, in the simplest possible way, by using
real examples, based on common tasks that many users want to
accomplish.

After reading this section you should continue with
the [Authorization](#authorization), in order to learn all the details
on the best way to authenticate to our server.

The most important section is the [Sync](#sync) section, and you
should read it next, where the way that the API works is explained.

The other sections are the reference documentation of the different
Todoist objects and endpoints, and you can continue reading them in
the order you need them.


## Python library

We currently have an official Python library supported by Doist to make the
developer life easier.

> You can install todoist python library via pip:

```shell
$ pip install todoist-python

You can find the [Python library source code](https://github.com/doist/todoist-python) at its repository at Github.

You can also read the [Python library documentation](http://todoist-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) online.
