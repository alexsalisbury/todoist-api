# Webhooks

The Todoist Webhooks API allows applications to receive real-time notification
(in the form of HTTP POST payload) on the subscribed user events. Notice that
once you have a webhook setup, you will start receiving webhook events from
**all your app users** immediately.

### Important Considerations

Due to the nature of network requests, your application should assume webhook
requests could arrive out of order or could even fail to arrive; webhooks should
be used only as notifications and not as a primary Todoist data source (make
sure your application could still work when webhook is not available).


## Configuration

Before you can start receiving webhook event notifications, you must first have
your webhook configured at the App Management Console.

### Events

Here is a list of events that you could subscribe to, and they are configured at
the [App Management Console](/appconsole.html).

Event Name | Description
-------- | -----------
item:added | An item was added
item:updated | An item was updated
item:deleted | An item was deleted
item:completed | An item was completed
item:uncompleted | An item was uncompleted
note:added | A note was added
note:updated | A note was updated
note:deleted | A note was deleted
project:added | A project was added
project:updated | A project was updated
project:deleted | A project was deleted
project:archived |  A project was archived
project:unarchived | A project was unarchived
label:added | A label was added
label:deleted | A label was deleted
label:updated | A label was updated
filter:added | A filter was added
filter:deleted | A filter was deleted
filter:updated | A filter was updated
reminder:fired | A reminder has fired


## Request Format

### Event JSON Object

Each webhook event notification request contains a JSON object. The event JSON
object follows this general structure:

`{"event_name": "...", "user_id"=..., "event_data": {...}}`

The `user_id` points to the destination of the event.

The structure of the `event_data` object varies depending on the type of event
it is. For instance, if it is an "item:added" event notification, The
"event_data" will represent the newly added item.

      "collapsed": 0,
      "date_string": ""
    }
}
...
```

### Request Header

Header Name | Description
-------- | -----------
User-Agent | Will be set to "Todoist-Webhooks"
X-Todoist-Hmac-SHA256 | To verify each webhook request was indeed sent by Todoist, an `X-Todoist-Hmac-SHA256` header is included; it is a SHA256 Hmac generated using your `client_secret` as the encryption key and the whole request payload as the message to be encrypted. The resulting Hmac would be encoded in a base64 string.
X-Todoist-Delivery-ID | Each webhook event notification has a unique `X-Todoist-Delivery-ID`. When a notification request failed to be delivered to your endpoint, the request would be re-delivered with the same `X-Todoist-Delivery-ID`.


### Failed Delivery

When an event notification failed to be delivered to your webhook callback URL
endpoint (i.e. due to server error, network failure, incorrect response, etc),
it would be re-delivered after 15 mins, and each notification would be
re-delivered for at most three times.

**Your callback endpoint must respond with a HTTP 200 when receiving an event
notification request.**

A response other than HTTP 200 would be considered as failed delivery, and the
notification would be delivered again.
